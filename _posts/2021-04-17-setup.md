I often get questions about which editor, font or color scheme i'm using. Instead of replying to those questions individually i've also, like many others, decided to just write down the settings and apps that i'm using.

## IDE [#](#ide)

I mainly program PHP. Mostly i develop in VS Code. Here's a screenshot of it:

I'm using github-theme-dark (dimmed) theme. The font used is the Fira Code font, that you can download [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) last time i checked.

Like seen in the screenshot i've hidden a lot of things of the UI of VSCode. I like to keep it minimal. Most of the time the Explorer sidebar is closed and backup my settings to GitHub.

I used to like working using a light based theme, but recently start to like the dark themes. Github has also created a light theme which is also simple and nice. Watch [this excellent video](https://youtu.be/rDMI1dpNfdw?t=353) by Spatie's Brent to learn what the benefits of using a light based theme might be.

Mostly i work on Laravel projects. One of my favourite VS Code extensions is Laravel Idea, which can do stuff like autocomplete route names, request fields, and a whole lot more. It's paid, but definitely worth it.

## Terminal [#](#terminal)

Here's a screenshot from my terminal.

All my terminal settings are saved in my dotfiles repository. I wil soon make it public so you can see how they look and if you want the same environment you follow the installation instructions of the repo.

I still use the default Mac OS terminal with the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

The color scheme used is the default robbyrussel theme and i just changed some colors in the terminal settings.

## MacOS [#](#macos)

I've stopped upgrading super fast to the latest version, before someone confirmed it's running fine.

These are some of the apps i'm using:

* To run projects locally I use Laravel Valet.
* I really like [Raycast](https://raycast.com). I'm using several workflows, which i will show later.
* To connect to sftp servers I use [Forklift](https://binarynights.com/).
* Databases are managed with [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)
* My favourite cloud storage solution is [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/). All my personal documents are on there.
* If you're not using a password manager, you're doing it wrong. I use Bitwarden since a few months and it does things well.
* All settings of my apps are backupped to Dropbox through [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup). This is a fantastic piece of software that moves all your preferences to Dropbox and symlinks them.

## Hardware [#](#hardware)

I'm using a Macbook Pro with an Apple M1 processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB hard disk.

Here's a picture of the desk I have at home.
