I often get questions about which editor, font or color scheme I'm using. Instead of replying to those questions individually I've also, like many others,
decided to just write down the settings and apps that I'm using.

## IDE [#](#ide)

I mainly program PHP. Mostly I develop in VS Code. Here's a screenshot of it:

I'm using github-theme-dark (dimmed) theme. The font used is the Fira Code font, that you can download [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) last time i checked.

Like seen in the screenshot I've hidden a lot of things of the UI of VSCode. I like to keep it minimal. Most of the time the Explorer sidebar is closed and backup my settings to GitHub.

I used to kike working using a light based theme, but recently start to like the dark themes. Github has also created a light theme which is also simple and nice. Watch [this excellent video](https://youtu.be/rDMI1dpNfdw?t=353) by Spatie's Brent to learn what the benefits of using a light based theme might be.

Mostly I work on Laravel projects. One of my favourite VS Code extensions is Laravel Idea, which can do stuff like autocomplete route names, request fields, and a whole lot more. It's paid, but definitely worth it.

## Terminal [#](#terminal)

Here's a screenshot from my terminal.
