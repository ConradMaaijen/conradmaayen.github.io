Code style must follow [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). Generally speaking, everything string-like that's not public-facing should use camelCase. Detailed examples on these are spread throughout the guide in their relevant sections.

### NULLABLE AND UNION TYPES

Whenever possible use the short nullable notation of a type, instead of using a union of the type with null.

```php
// in a class

// good
public ?string $variable;

// bad
public string | null $variable;
```

### VOID RETURN TYPES

If a method returns nothing, it should be indicated with void. This makes it more clear to the users of your code what your intention was when writing it.

```php
// good

// in a Laravel model
public function scopeArchived(Builder $query): void
{
    $query->
        ...
}
```
