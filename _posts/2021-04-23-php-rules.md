Code style must follow [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). Generally speaking, everything string-like that's not public-facing should use camelCase. Detailed examples on these are spread throughout the guide in their relevant sections.

### General PHP Rules

#### NULLABLE AND UNION TYPES

Whenever possible use the short nullable notation of a type, instead of using a union of the type with null.

```php
// in a class

// good
public ?string $variable;

// bad
public string | null $variable;
```

#### VOID RETURN TYPES

If a method returns nothing, it should be indicated with void. This makes it more clear to the users of your code what your intention was when writing it.

```php
// good

// in a Laravel model
public function scopeArchived(Builder $query): void
{
    $query->
        ...
}
```

### Typed properties

You should type a property whenever possible. Don't use a docblock.

```php
// good
class Foo
{
    public string $bar;
}

// bad
class Foo
{
    /** @var string */
    public $bar;
}
```

### Docblocks

Don't use docblocks for methods that can be fully type hinted (unless you need a description).

Only add a description when it provides more context than the method signature itself. Use full sentences for descriptions, including a period at the end.

```php
// Good
class Url
{
    public static function fromString(string $url): Url
    {
        // ...
    }
}

// Bad: The description is redundant, and the method is fully type-hinted.
class Url
{
    /**
     * Create a url from a string.
     *
     * @param string $url
     *
     * @return \Spatie\Url\Url
     */
    public static function fromString(string $url): Url
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Traits

Each applied trait should go on its own line, and the use keyword should be used for each of them. This will result in clean diffs when traits are added or removed.

```php
// Good
class MyClass {
    use TraitA;
    use TraitB;
}

// Bad
class MyClass {
    use TraitA, TraitB;
}
```

### Strings

When possible prefer string interpolation above sprintf and the . operator.

```php
// Good
$greeting = "Hi, I am {$name}.";

// Bad
$greeting = 'Hi, I am ' . $name . '.';
```

### Ternary operators

Every portion of a ternary expression should be on its own line unless it's a really short expression.

```php
// Good
$name = $isFoo ? 'foo' : 'bar';

// Bad
$result = $object instanceof Model ?
    $object->name :
   'A default value';
```

### If statements

#### BRACKET POSITION

Always use curly brackets.

```php
// Good
if ($condition) {
   ...
}

// Bad
if ($condition) ...
```

#### HAPPY PATH

Generally a function should have its unhappy path first and its happy path last. In most cases this will cause the happy path being in an unindented part of the function which makes it more readable.

```php
// Good

if (! $goodCondition) {
  throw new Exception;
}

// do work
// Bad

if ($goodCondition) {
 // do work
}

throw new Exception;
```

#### AVOID ELSE

In general, else should be avoided because it makes code less readable. In most cases it can be refactored using early returns. This will also cause the happy path to go last, which is desirable.

```php
// Good

if (! $conditionA) {
   // condition A failed

   return;
}

if (! $conditionB) {
   // condition A passed, B failed

   return;
}

// condition A and B passed
```

```php
// Bad
if ($conditionA) {
   if ($conditionB) {
      // condition A and B passed
   }
   else {
     // condition A passed, B failed
   }
}
else {
   // condition A failed
}
```

#### COMPOUND IFS

In general, separate if statements should be preferred over a compound condition. This makes debugging code easier.

```php
// Good
if (! $conditionA) {
   return;
}

if (! $conditionB) {
   return;
}

if (! $conditionC) {
   return;
}

// do stuff
```

```php
// bad
if ($conditionA && $conditionB && $conditionC) {
  // do stuff
}
```

### Comments

Comments should be avoided as much as possible by writing expressive code. If you do need to use a comment, format it like this:

```php
// There should be a space before a single line comment.

/*
 * If you need to explain a lot you can use a comment block. Notice the
 * single * on the first line. Comment blocks don't need to be three
 * lines long or three characters shorter than the previous line.
 */
 ```

 A possible strategy to refactor away a comment is to create a function with name that describes the comment

```php
// Good
$this->calculateLoans();
```

```php
// Bad

// Start calculating loans
```
