### NULLABLE AND UNION TYPES

Whenever possible use the short nullable notation of a type, instead of using a union of the type with null.

```php
// in a class

// good
public ?string $variable;

// bad
public string | null $variable;
```

### VOID RETURN TYPES

If a method returns nothing, it should be indicated with void. This makes it more clear to the users of your code what your intention was when writing it.

```php
// good

// in a Laravel model
public function scopeArchived(Builder $query): void
{
    $query->
        ...
}
```
