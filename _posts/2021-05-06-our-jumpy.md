Last year we finaly did it! We bought a van.

<!--more-->

A 2 liter petrol Citroen Jumpy 2. The reason that we did not want
a somewhat cheaper diesel van is that in the near future we cannot drive in some cities in Europe with a diesel van.

To make a van look a bit like a van you need to put roof bars on it:

To preserve some precious space in this smaller low-roof van we decided to put a roofbox on top. Here we can store out awning and other lighter stuff.

We bought a Farad roof box at [Faradbox](https://www.faradbox.nl). (No.. i don't get paid to mention them, but after their great service an advise i thought they deserved it). When delivered the nex day i was a bit afraid 1,80m was bit big, but after we mounted it on the roof bars, its looks great and not too big on our van.
