Last year we finaly did it! We bought a van.

<!--more-->

A 2 liter petrol Citroen Jumpy 2. The reason that we did not want
a somewhat cheaper diesel van is that in the near future we cannot drive in some cities in Europe with a diesel van.

To make a van look a bit like a van you need to put roof bars on it:

To preserve some precious space in this smaller low-roof van we decided to put a roofbox on top. Here we can store out awning and other lighter stuff.

We bought a Farad roof box at [Faradbox](https://www.faradbox.nl). (No.. i don't get paid to mention them, but after their great service and advise i thought they deserved it). When delivered the next day i was a bit afraid 1,80m was bit big, but after we mounted it on the roof bars, its looks great and not too big on our van.

## The awning

Because our Jumpy is a low roof van, we only use the van for:
storage, sleeping, sitting etc, so we definitely need some space to stand and walk. Ever changed clothes sitting on a couch?

After trying a [Bardani](https://www.dewitschijndel.nl/bardani-midway-bustent/) awning first, we realized that we wanted a awning with multiple doors on all sides, because if the camping space is smaller and we want to drive away to get some shopping eg. the front of the awning is pointing to the side of the camping space. So having another part of the awning that can be opened is a big plus.

We finaly chose the [Vago Kela Air low](https://www.vango.co.uk/nl/awnings/150-kela-v-air-low.html) for our van with 5 doors and a big front door, so when the weather is very nice we can open up the awning completely. Also this one has a somewhat bigger space between the awning and the van, that you can enter form both sides.

And we just need a pump to get it up...
