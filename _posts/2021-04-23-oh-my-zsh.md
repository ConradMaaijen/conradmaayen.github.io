I spend a lot of my day in the terminal, and my shell of choice is Zsh — a highly customizable Unix shell that packs some very powerful features. I’m always looking for ways to type less and to automate all the things. Luckily this is something that Zsh lends itself well to.

In this post, you will find commands, plugins, aliases and tools that will save you some keystrokes and make you more productive in your day-to-day work.

If you don’t have Zsh installed on your machine, then [check out this post](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) to get it up and running.

### Things Zsh Can Do out of the Box

Zsh shares a lot of handy features with Bash. None of the following are unique to Zsh, but they’re good to know nonetheless. I encourage you to start using the command line to perform operations such as those listed below. It might seem like more work than using a GUI at first, but once you get the hang of things, you’ll never look back.

- Entering `cd` from anywhere on the file system will bring you straight back to your home directory.
- Entering `!!` will bring up the last command. This is handy if a command fails because it needs admin rights. In this case you can type `sudo !!`.
