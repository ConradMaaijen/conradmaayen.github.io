I spend a lot of my day in the terminal, and my shell of choice is Zsh — a highly customizable Unix shell that packs some very powerful features. I’m always looking for ways to type less and to automate all the things. Luckily this is something that Zsh lends itself well to.

In this post, you will find commands, plugins, aliases and tools that will save you some keystrokes and make you more productive in your day-to-day work.

If you don’t have Zsh installed on your machine, then [check out this post](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) to get it up and running.

## Things Zsh Can Do out of the Box

Zsh shares a lot of handy features with Bash. None of the following are unique to Zsh, but they’re good to know nonetheless. I encourage you to start using the command line to perform operations such as those listed below. It might seem like more work than using a GUI at first, but once you get the hang of things, you’ll never look back.

* Entering `cd` from anywhere on the file system will bring you straight back to your home directory.
* Entering `!!` will bring up the last command. This is handy if a command fails because it needs admin rights. In this case you can type `sudo !!`.
* You can use `&&` to chain multiple commands. For example, `mkdir project && cd project && npm init -y`.
* Conditional execution is possible using `||`. For example, `git commit -m "whatever..." || echo "Commit failed"`.
* Using a `-p` switch with the `mkdir` command will allow you to create parent directories as needed. Using brace expansion reduces repetition. For example, `mkdir -p articles/jim/sitepoint/article{1,2,3}`.
* Set environment variables on a per-command basis like so: `NODE_DEBUG=myapp node index.js`. Or, on a per-session basis like so: `export NODE_DEBUG=myapp`. You can check it was set by typing `echo $<variable-name>`.
* Pipe the output of one command into a second command. For example, `cat /var/log/kern.log | less` to make a long log readable, or `history | grep ssh` to search for any history entries containing “ssh”.
* You can open files in your editor from the terminal. For example, `nano ~/.zshrc` (nano), `subl ~/.zshrc` (Sublime Text), `code ~/.zshrc` (VS Code). If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created when you press Save in the editor.
* Navigation is an important skill to master. Don’t just rely on your arrow keys. For example, `Ctrl + a` will take you to the beginning of a line.
* Whereas `Ctrl + e` will take you to the end.
* You can use `Ctrl + w` to delete one word (backw­ards).
* `Ctrl + u` will remove everything from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
* `Ctrl + k` will clear everything from the cursor to the end of the line. These last three can be undone with `Ctrl + y`.
* You can copy text with `Ctrl + Shift + c`. This is much more elegant than right clicking and selecting *Copy*.
* Conversely, you can paste copied text with `Ctrl + shift + v`.

Try to commit those key combos to memory. You’ll be surprised at how often they come in handy.

## Cool Things You Can Do with (Oh My) Zsh
[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is a community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration and comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins and themes. If you’re going to make the Z shell your daily driver, you should really install Oh My Zsh.

Here are useful things Oh My Zsh can do for you:

* The `take` command will create a new directory and change into it. take my-project replaces mkdir my-project && cd my-project.
* `zsh_stats` will give you a list of the top 20 commands and how many times they’ve been run.
* Oh My Zsh simplifies navigating your file system. For example, `..` is an alias for `cd ..`.
* In the same way, `...` moves you up two directories, `....` moves you up three, and `.....` moves you up four.
* You can omit the cd when navigating. Typing `/`, for example, will take you straight to your filesystem root.
* Partial matching is also supported. For example, typing `/u/c/De` and pressing `TAB`, then `Return`, takes me to `/Users/conrad/Desktop/` on my Mac, on Linux it should be eg. `/h/c/De`.
* `rd` is an alias for `rmdir` and `md` is an alias for `mkdir -p`.
* You can type `d` to list the last used directories from a terminal session.
* You can then navigate to any of these using `cd -n`, where `n` is the directory number.
* Tab completion is another great feature. For example, typing `ls -` and pressing `TAB` will list all of the command’s options, along with a helpful description of what they do. This also works for `cap`, `rake`, `ssh`, and `kill`.
* Typing `alias` lists all of your current aliases.
* With globbing (a Zsh feature), you can list files with a particular extension. For example, `ls *.html` will list all HTML files in the current directory. To include subdirectories, change to: `ls **/*.html`.
* Glob qualifiers allow you to select types of files by using flags. For example, `ls -l **/*(.x)` will find all executable files in the current directory and all sub-directories.
* You can search for files by date modified. For example, `ls *(m-7)` will list all files modified within the last week.
* You can search for files by size. For example, `ls *(Lm+1)` will find all files with a size larger than 1MB.

## Using Plugins for Fun and Profit

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/plugins) ships with a lot of plugins. You should look through these and invest some time learning those that will help your workflow.

Here is a plugins I regularly use, that provide a ton of handy shortcuts and aliases.

### Git

The git plugin provides many aliases and several useful functions. Why not go through these and attempt to memorize your top ten? Here are the ones I use most often.

1. `g` is a handy alias for `git`. This means you can type things like `g clone <whatever>` instead of `git clone <whatever>`. Might only be two keystrokes, but they soon add up.
2. `gaa` is an alias for `git add all`. I use this one all the time.
3. `gb` is an alias for `git branch`, which will list all of the branches in the current repo and show you which one you’re on.
4. `gcb` is an alias for `git checkout -b`, the command that allows you to create a new branch.
5. `gcm` is an alias for `git checkout main`. This returns you to the main branch.
6. `gdca` is an alias for `git diff --cached`. This allows you to diff any files you’ve staged for commit.
7. `gf` is an alias for `git fetch`.
8. `gm` is an alias for `git merge`.
9. `gp` is an alias for `git push`. To sync a fork of a repo, you could do: `gf upstream`, `gm upstream/main`, followed by `gp`.
10. `glog` is an alias for `git log --oneline --decorate --graph`, which will give you a pretty git branch graph.

## Additional Resources
The main job of the plugins listed above is to provide aliases to often-used commands. Please be aware that there are lots more plugins out there that augment your shell with additional functionality.

Here are four of my favorites:

* [sudo](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/sudo) allows you to easily prefix your current or previous commands with `sudo` by pressing `ESC` twice.
* [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) suggests commands as you type based on history and completions. If the suggestion is the one you’re looking for, press the → key to accept it. A real time saver!
* [z is a handy plugin](https://github.com/rupa/z) that builds a list of your most frequent and recent folders (it calls these “frecent”) and allows you to jump to them with one command.

And don’t forget, if you spend a lot of time in the terminal, it’s worth investing some effort in making it visually appealing. Luckily, Oh My Zsh ships with a whole bunch of themes for you to choose from.
