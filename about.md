I'm a PHP developer and Laravel enthusiast. Most of my time is spent at Osec B.V.

At Osec for the internal and external websites we use mostly open source software: PHP, Ubuntu, Laravel, Composer, Git,â€¦ are a few of the things we use everyday.
See the [uses](/uses) page for a list of hardware and software i use every day.
